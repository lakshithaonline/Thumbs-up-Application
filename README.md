# Thumbs-up-Application
There is a community called FOSS community in our university (NSBM Green University). They organized event called UX/UI Hackathon. That's a competition. So, we participated. They gave us a scenario. What we have to do is we have to design a mobile application for that scenario. They gave a several web applications to design the application. They are Figma, Photoshop, Sketch, Adobe xd, and Adobe illustrator. we can use only these web applications for design the mobile app. So, we choose "Figma". We completed that one day project very successfully with my team members.
